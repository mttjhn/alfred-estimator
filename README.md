## Requirements
1. [Alfred App 3](http://www.alfredapp.com/#download)
2. [Alfred Powerpack](https://buy.alfredapp.com/)

## Commands
- `estim`
    * Takes the user's input as a number or math expression (e.g. `(40-2)*1.2) + 3`) and calculates a "full" estimate assuming that the input is only 52% of the actual effort. Provides the results in hours or days (assuming 8-hour days). üòÅ
